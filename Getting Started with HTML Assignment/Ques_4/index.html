    <title>HTML Tags and Elements</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Tags :</h1>
    
    <p>Tags are the basic building blocks of HTML. They are enclosed within angle brackets (&lt; &gt;) and are used to define elements on a web page. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag contains the name of the element, while the closing tag is the same as the opening tag but with a forward slash (/) before the tag name. Tags tell the browser how to structure the content on the web page.</p>
    
    <p>Example of a tag pair: &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
    
    <p>In this example, &lt;p&gt; is the opening tag, and &lt;/p&gt; is the closing tag. The content between the opening and closing tags forms the paragraph element.</p>
    
    <h1>Elements :</h1>

    <p>Elements are made up of tags, content, and attributes. An element begins with a start tag, followed by the content, and ends with an end tag. Some elements can be self-closing, meaning they don't have a separate closing tag but are closed within the opening tag itself.</p>
    
    <p>Example of an element with attributes:</p>
    
    &lt;a&gt; href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit Example&lt;/a&gt; 
    
    <p>In this example, &lt;a&gt; is the opening tag, &lt;/a&gt; is the closing tag, and href="https://www.example.com" is an attribute specifying the hyperlink URL. The content between the opening and closing tags is the text displayed as a clickable link.</p>
