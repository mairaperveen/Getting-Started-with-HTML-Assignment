    <h1>Declaration in HTML</h1>
    <p>The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML (Document Type Declaration) is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the document is written in. It is a crucial part of an HTML document because it helps the browser to render the web page correctly. The DOCTYPE declaration is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag.

    In HTML5, the DOCTYPE declaration looks like this:</p>
    <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        
        &lt;html&gt; lang="en">
          <!-- The rest of your HTML document goes here -->
          &lt;/html&gt;
        </p>
        <p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;: This declaration specifies that the document is an HTML5 document. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and is widely supported by modern web browsers. The declaration is case-insensitive, meaning you can also write it as &lt;doctype html&gt; or &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;.</p>
